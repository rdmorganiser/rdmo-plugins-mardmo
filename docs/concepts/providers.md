# Dynamic Optionset Providers

Many questionnaire fields in MaRDMO require the user to reference an external entity — a piece of software, a mathematical model, an algorithm, a research problem, and so on.  These fields are backed by *dynamic optionset providers*: Python classes that the RDMO frontend calls whenever the user types into an autocomplete widget, returning a ranked list of matching items from external knowledge bases or from the current project.

## Three Provider Tiers

Providers are organised into three tiers of increasing capability.

### Tier 1 — Pure search

The simplest providers query the **MaRDI Portal**, or the **MaRDI Portal and Wikidata**, and return whatever matches.  A "not found" option is sometimes included so the user can explicitly signal that no appropriate item exists.

### Tier 2 — Search + project items

Tier 2 providers extend Tier 1 by also surfacing items the user has already defined or selected elsewhere in the **current RDMO project**.  This lets a user re-reference an entity they documented in an earlier section without having to look it up again.

### Tier 3 — Search + project items + inline creation

The most capable providers add the ability to **create a new item on the fly**.  The user types a plain-text label and a short description — the same two pieces of information that a result returned from an external source would carry — and the provider wraps this in a special option that later triggers item creation in the MaRDI Portal during export.  Items entered this way are visually distinguishable from portal or Wikidata results by the absence of a source tag: a portal result appears as `Euler method (numerical ODE solver) [mardi]`, a Wikidata result as `Euler method (numerical ODE solver) [wikidata]`, while an inline-created item appears as `My solver (custom ODE solver)` with no tag.

## MaRDI Portal vs Wikidata Search

For the **MaRDI Portal**, providers use a class-restricted search: only items that are an *instance of* the relevant item class are returned.  For **Wikidata**, an **unrestricted** search is used instead — equivalent to typing a term directly into the Wikidata search bar.  The reason for this asymmetry is that Wikidata's class hierarchy is too heterogeneous for reliable filtering: a piece of software might be `instance of free software` rather than `instance of software`, making a class-restricted query miss many valid results.

## Autocomplete Mechanism

The following steps happen each time the user types in an autocomplete field:

1. **Debounced request** — after a short pause the browser sends an HTTP request to the Django backend, passing the current search term.

2. **`query_api_per_class`** — the backend fires a [CirrusSearch](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:CirrusSearch) query against the MediaWiki API.  CirrusSearch is the Elasticsearch-backed full-text search engine embedded in Wikibase/MediaWiki.  The `haswbstatement` keyword is a CirrusSearch extension that filters results to items carrying a specific property-value pair:

    ```
    GET /w/api.php
      ?action=query
      &list=search
      &srsearch=euler* haswbstatement:P31=Q68663
      &format=json
    ```

    Here `P31` is the *instance of* property and `Q68663` is the item class QID (e.g. *mathematical model*).  The trailing `*` enables prefix matching so partial input is handled gracefully.

3. **`wbgetentities` follow-up** — the QIDs returned by the search are resolved to English labels and descriptions via a second API call:

    ```
    GET /w/api.php
      ?action=wbgetentities
      &ids=Q42|Q137|Q951
      &props=labels|descriptions
      &languages=en
      &format=json
    ```

4. **Cache** — results are stored in Django's cache framework so that repeated searches for the same term avoid redundant API calls.

5. **Merge and return** — for Tier 2 and 3 providers, matching project items are appended to the external results before the list is returned to the autocomplete widget.
